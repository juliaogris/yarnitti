// Dodeca: the vertex connector for a dowel dodecahedron.
//
// A dodecahedron has twenty vertices and thirty edges. Three edges meet at
// every vertex, 108 degrees apart, the interior angle of the pentagon they
// bound. Every edge is its own dowel, and no dowel passes through a
// connector, so the frame is one printed part:
//
//   dodeca_vertex  x20  joins three dowel ends at a vertex
//
// With 300 mm dowels the edge is 306.3 mm and the frame is 866 mm across.
// The echo below the constants prints both for any dowel_len.
//
// Render:
//   openscad -o dodeca_vertex.stl -D 'part="dodeca_vertex"' dodeca.scad
